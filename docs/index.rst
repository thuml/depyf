Welcome to the documentation of ``depyf``
==========================================

``depyf`` is a software tool to leverage advanced Python features to open up internal details of PyTorch's compiler ``torch.compile``, so that users can understand it, adapt to it, and tune their code to get maximum performance benefit out of it.

Before learning the usage of ``depyf``, we recommend reading the :doc:`walk_through` example of ``torch.compile``, so that you can understand how ``depyf`` would help you.
