Welcome to the documentation of `depyf`
========================================

`depyf` is a software tool to leverage advanced Python features to open up internal details of PyTorch's compiler `torch.compile`, so that users can understand it, adapt to it, and tune their code to get maximum performance benefit out of it.

Before learning the usage of `depyf`, we recommend reading the :doc:`walk_through` example of `torch.compile`, so that you can understand how `depyf` would help you.
